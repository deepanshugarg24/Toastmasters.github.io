<h1 align="center" color="white">COLLOQUIOS</h1>
<p align="center" color="#772432">The University Club has been very active and consistent in organising meetings for the active participation of all it's members. The students work
on every aspect of their speaking skills while they are given roles to perform that change evrey week along with the topic of the meeting. The meetings known as the 'Colloquios' among the 
club members stretch the skills of all the participants in every manner possible.</p>
<p align="center" color="#772432">In a colloquio, some of the members are given the role of a prepared speaker and are provided by the topic for the colloquio. These speakers prepare their
speeches before the meeting and the are judged by other role bearing students. Then is the time for the fun filled 'Table Topics', which is an on-the-spot speaking competition conducted by
one of the team members.</p>
<p align="center" color="#772432">All these events bring out the very best of a student and lead them to the path of success and <em>MAKING THEM A LEADER!</em></p>
